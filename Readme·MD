# 🔐 AI-Driven Smart Contract Security Analyzer

AI-powered tool for detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

## 🎯 About

This application uses machine learning to analyze Solidity smart contracts and detect potential reentrancy vulnerabilities - one of the most critical security issues in blockchain development.

### Features
- ✅ Real-time smart contract analysis
- ✅ Reentrancy vulnerability detection
- ✅ Risk scoring and assessment
- ✅ Detailed security recommendations
- ✅ Pattern recognition for vulnerable code
- ✅ Interactive web interface

cd smart-contract-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

## 📊 How It Works

The analyzer examines your smart contract for:

1. **External Call Patterns** - `.call()`, `.transfer()`, `.send()`
2. **State Management** - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
3. **Security Mechanisms** - `nonReentrant` modifiers, mutex locks
4. **Vulnerable Patterns** - State changes after external calls
5. **Access Controls** - `require()`, `assert()`, modifiers

## 🔍 Usage

1. Paste your Solidity contract into the code editor
2. Click "Analyze Contract"
3. Review the risk assessment and recommendations
4. Use sample contracts to learn about safe vs. vulnerable patterns

## ⚠️ What is Reentrancy?

Reentrancy occurs when a contract makes an external call before updating its state, allowing malicious contracts to recursively call back and potentially drain funds. This vulnerability was exploited in the infamous 2016 DAO hack.

### Vulnerable Pattern:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");  // External call FIRST
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;       // State change AFTER ⚠️
}
```

### Safe Pattern:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) public nonReentrant {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;       // State change FIRST ✓
    msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");  // External call AFTER
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details
